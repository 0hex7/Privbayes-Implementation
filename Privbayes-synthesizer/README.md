## Privbayes via synthesizer

This part of the repository demonstrates the usage of Privbayes with optimization. The code is optimized to function within 7 seconds to generate over 40,000 records along with the Bayesian network.

### Usage

To use Privbayes via synthesizer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the code `privbayes.py` with the desired parameters.
4. Check the generated records along with the Bayesian network.
5. Also check the resultant graphs which clearly describe the similarities between both datasets.

### Optimization

The code has been optimized to ensure efficient execution. By implementing various techniques, we have achieved the ability to generate over 40,000 records within 7 seconds. This optimization allows for faster data generation and analysis, making Privbayes via synthesizer a powerful tool for privacy-preserving data synthesis.

### Bayesian Network

In addition to generating records, Privbayes via synthesizer also constructs a Bayesian network. The Bayesian network captures the probabilistic relationships between different attributes in the generated data. This network can be used for various purposes, such as data analysis, inference, and decision-making.

### Contributing
